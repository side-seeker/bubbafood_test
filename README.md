The customer application should allow customers to:
•	Sign up and login
•	Browse through menus of all three brands
•	Place orders for delivery and takeaway
•	Book table for dining
•	Redeem reward points for their purchases
•	See the food items that have ingredients that are available. 
•	See history of their past orders and allow them to easily reorder their favourite items.
•	Provide feedback, complaints, and enquiries. The application should be integrated with the existing backend CRM system to maintain inventory, track sales, and manage reward points. The application should also integrate APIs to take orders from food delivery apps.
•	Seamlessly manage online payments and cash on delivery options.
